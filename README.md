# -UI-UX-Project
Designed a pizza delivery restaurant app named Pizzalecious with the help of the software Figma
This project uses Figma to design a pizza delivery app for a restaurant called Pizzalecious.
The app includes features like prototyping, UI design, and report making. This means it's not just a static design; it likely shows how a user would interact with the app, including ordering pizza and side dishes.
